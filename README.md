# Software_Component_Design

This course deals with the design and implementation of software subsystems. The concept of design patterns is introduced and common patterns are applied to the development of software components. Laboratory projects provide an opportunity for students to implement components and to integrate them into complete systems. As a final assignment, small teams of students conduct research on software design patterns and present & demonstrate the results of their investigations to the class.
