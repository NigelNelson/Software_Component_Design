Lab 2: CrypStick (Strategy Pattern)

In this lab you will use the strategy pattern to build a portable device for carrying secure messages known as a CrypStick. When a message is entered into the CrypStick, it is encrypted before storing on the internal media. When a message is read from the internal media, it is decrypted. Thus (after the encryption method is cleared) anyone who steals the media must also break the encryption to reveal the message. This is an individual lab.
