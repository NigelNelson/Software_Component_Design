Lab 5: Decorated Networks

In this lab you will develop a tool using the Decorator Pattern to display feed-forward neural networks. A neural network takes data from some source such as pixels from an image or samples from an audio stream and generates a number specifying a classification of that input. For example, an output of 0.9 could indicate a cat is in an image and an output of 0.1 could indicate it is a dog. Feed-forward neural networks are ones in which the signal enters at one end, flows through the network, and exits without looping backwards on itself. For example, in the network below, the input is on the left and the output on the right.
